            <p></p><Engines are the heart of any vehicle, transforming fuel into the power needed to move cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other forms of transportation. The engines in modern vehicles are marvels of engineering, and there are several types commonly used today, each with unique characteristics and applications.<br><br>
                <div class="section" id="section1"><a href=""><h2>Internal Combustion Engines (ICE)</h2></a>

                <blockquote>The most prevalent type of engine found in vehicles is the internal combustion engine. These engines operate by igniting a mixture of fuel and air within a cylinder, creating a controlled explosion that pushes a piston.<br><br><img src="c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\ice 1.jpg" alt="engine"><br><br><br> The movement of this piston turns a crankshaft, which ultimately drives the vehicle's wheels. There are two main types of internal combustion engines: gasoline engines and diesel engines.<br><br><img src="c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\ice 2.jpg" alt=""><br><br><br></blockquote></div>
                <div class="section" id="section2"></div><b>Hybrid Engines</b>

                <blockquote>Hybrid engines combine internal combustion engines with electric motors to provide a balance of power and efficiency. These engines can switch between or simultaneously use both the internal combustion engine and electric motor.<br><img src="c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\hybrid engine2.webp" alt=""> <br> This setup allows hybrids to achieve higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions compared to traditional ICE vehicles. There are different types of hybrid systems, such as parallel hybrids, where both the engine and motor can drive the wheels, and series hybrids, where the engine generates electricity for the motor.</blockquote><br><br></div>
                <div class="section" id="section3"></div><b>Electric Engines</b>

                <blockquote>engines, or electric motors, are powered entirely by electricity stored in batteries. These engines are highly efficient, quiet, and produce zero tailpipe emissions.Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their environmental benefits and advancements in battery technology, which have improved range and charging times. Electric engines provide instant torque, offering quick acceleration and a smooth driving experience. However, the infrastructure for charging and the current limitations in battery range and cost are challenges that the industry continues to address.<br><br></blockquote></div>
                <div class="section" id="section4"></div><b>Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines</b><br><br>
                <img src="c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\hfc1.jpg" alt="" height="400" weight="400">

                <blockquote>fuel cell engines are an emerging technology that generates electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, with water and heat as byproducts. These engines produce zero emissions and can offer longer ranges than battery-electric vehicles. However, hydrogen infrastructure is still in its infancy, and there are challenges related to the production, storage, and distribution of hydrogen.<br></blockquote></div>
                <div class="section" id="section5"></div><b>Steam Engines</b><br>
                
                <blockquote>While mostly obsolete today, steam engines were crucial in the industrial revolution. They operate by using steam pressure to move pistons or turbines.<br><br></blockquote></div>

                
                <div class="section" id="section6"></div><b>Jet Engines</b><br><br>
                <img src="c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\jet image.jpeg" alt="" >
                <blockquote>Primarily used in aviation, jet engines produce thrust by expelling jet streams at high velocity.<br><br></blockquote></div>
                <div class="section" id="section7"><b>Rocket Engines</b><br>
                    <img src="c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\rocket2.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="300"><br>
                    <blockquote>Used in space applications, rocket engines expel mass to produce thrust according to Newtonâ€™s third law.<br></blockquote></div>
