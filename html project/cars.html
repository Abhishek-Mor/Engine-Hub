        <div class="section" id="section5"><h3>Diesel Engines:</h3></div><br>
        
        Known for their fuel efficiency and torque, commonly used in trucks, SUVs, and some passenger cars.A diesel engine is an internal combustion engine that operates using diesel fuel. It differs from a gasoline engine primarily in how the fuel is ignited. In a diesel engine, air is compressed to a much higher pressure than in a gasoline engine, creating a high temperature that ignites the diesel fuel when it is injected into the cylinder. This process, known as compression ignition, makes diesel engines more fuel-efficient and capable of generating more torque compared to their gasoline counterparts. Diesel engines are commonly used in heavy-duty vehicles like trucks, buses, and construction equipment, as well as in some cars, due to their durability and efficiency.<br>

        <div class="section" id="section7"><b>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):</b></div>Combine a traditional engine with an electric motor, allowing short trips on electric power alone. Examples include the Chevrolet Volt.A Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) combines a gasoline or diesel engine with an electric motor and a rechargeable battery that can be plugged into an external power source. This dual system allows PHEVs to run on electric power for short distances and switch to the internal combustion engine for longer trips. This provides greater flexibility and extended driving range compared to traditional hybrids. PHEVs offer the benefits of reduced emissions and lower fuel consumption, while still having the option to refuel quickly at gas stations for longer journeys. Examples of PHEVs include the Toyota Prius Prime and the Chevrolet Volt.<br>

         <h2>Hybrid Engines</h2><br>
         <div class="section" id="section8"><b>Mild Hybrid:</b></div>Provides electric assistance to the internal combustion engine for better efficiency. Examples include<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Motor_Assist">Hondaâ€™s Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)</a>.A mild hybrid vehicle, also known as a mild hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV), integrates a small electric motor with a traditional internal combustion engine. Unlike full hybrids or plug-in hybrids, mild hybrids cannot run on electric power alone. Instead, the electric motor assists the engine, improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. The system uses regenerative braking to recover energy during deceleration, which is then stored in a small battery. Mild hybrids are often more affordable than full hybrids and offer improved fuel economy without the need for charging infrastructure. They provide a smooth and efficient driving experience with enhanced performance, particularly during acceleration and in stop-start traffic.<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\mild engine.png" alt=""height="400" width="400"><br>
        
        <div class="section" id="section9"><b>Full Hybrid:</b></div> Can run on electric power alone for short distances. Examples include the Toyota Prius.A full hybrid vehicle, also known as a parallel hybrid, combines an internal combustion engine with one or more electric motors and a larger battery pack compared to mild hybrids. This setup allows the vehicle to operate using the electric motor alone, the combustion engine alone, or a combination of both. Full hybrids can run on electric power at low speeds and for short distances, improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. They also use regenerative braking to recharge the battery. Popular examples of full hybrid vehicles include the Toyota Prius and the Honda Accord Hybrid. This combination of power sources provides a balance of performance, efficiency, and environmental benefits without the need for external charging.<br>

        <div class="section" id="section10"><h2>Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines</h2></div><br>
        Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs): A fuel cell engine converts chemical energy from hydrogen into electricity through a reaction with oxygen in a fuel cell, consisting of an anode, cathode, and electrolyte membrane. Hydrogen is split into protons and electrons at the anode, with electrons creating an electric current as they travel through an external circuit to the cathode, where they combine with protons and oxygen to produce water and heat as byproducts. Fuel cell engines are highly efficient and produce zero emissions, making them an eco-friendly alternative used in vehicles, backup power systems, and portable power devices.</a>.<br>

        <div class="section" id="section11"><h2>Turbocharged Engines</h2></div><br>
        Smaller engines with turbochargers for better fuel economy and performance, commonly used in many modern vehicles to balance efficiency and power.A turbocharged engine is an internal combustion engine equipped with a turbocharger, which enhances its power and efficiency. The turbocharger is a turbine-driven device that uses exhaust gas to spin a compressor, forcing more air into the engine's cylinders. This increased air supply allows for more fuel to be burned, resulting in greater power output without increasing the engine's size. Turbocharged engines offer significant performance improvements, better fuel efficiency, and reduced emissions compared to naturally aspirated engines. They are commonly used in modern cars, trucks, and high-performance vehicles to deliver more power while maintaining fuel efficiency.<br>
